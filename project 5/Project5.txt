Instructions: This is an individual assignment.  All work should be your own.



Objective:

     Work with graphs and Kruskals algorithm for minimum spanning trees.

Overview:

     The pseudocode for Kruskals algorithm is given in the textbook to find a minimum
     spanning tree of a graph.  Your program will find the minimum spanning tree
     among a set of cities in Texas.

Details:

     Write a command-line program that uses Kruskal's algorithm to find a minimum spanning
     tree of a graph.  The graph will be provided as a file named assn9_data.csv.  The
     data in the file is in the form of an adjacency list.

     You must use the author's DisjSets class without modifying it.  You can either use
     one of the author's priority queue classes or you can use the PriorityQueue class
     provided in Java.

     You should output each edge of your minimum spanning tree as the names of the two
     cities and the distance between them.  You should also print the sum of all of the
     distances in the tree.
